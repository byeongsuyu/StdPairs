Module contents
======================

There are three classes `AffineMonoid <./affinemonoid.html>`_, `MonomialIdeal <./monomialideal.html>`_, and `ProperPair <./properpair.html>`_. A ``MonomialIdeal`` object represents an ideal in the affine monoid, and a proper pair represent a pair of a monomial (element) in the affine monoid and a face on the affine monoid, which is not contained in some fixed ideal. See `Yu, 2020 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08903>`_ or `Matusevich and Yu, 2020 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10968>`_ for details in mathematical context.
