StdPairs
====================================

StdPairs is a library of SageMath that gives symbolic computation over a monomial ideal of an affine (non-normal) semigroup ring. In particular, it provides associate prime ideals, multiplicity, and irredundant irreducible primary decomposition of a monomial ideal. It implements algorithms in [MY2020]_.

The source file can be found on the `github pages <https://github.com/byeongsuyu/StdPairs>`_.
