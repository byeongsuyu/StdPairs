<p>where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$SAGE_ROOT</span></code> is the folder your sage was compiled or installed. Make sure that testing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">monomialideal.py</span></code> file takes 2~3 minutes, unlike others. If one wants to test for more serious examples, we provide two test examples as below.</p>
